"""ARCH-06/ARCH-07: pins the api_core split so the extraction cannot silently rot.

``forven.api_core`` was 12,233 lines and five unrelated subsystems. Three of them
were lifted out (provider discovery, the POST-body models, the declarative half of
settings), each leaving a RE-EXPORT SHIM behind so that not one of the ~60 modules
and ~65 test files importing from ``forven.api_core`` had to change.

That shim is the entire safety argument for the split, and it is the kind of thing
that decays one "unused import" cleanup at a time. These tests make it executable:

  * every name defined in an extracted module must still be reachable from
    ``forven.api_core``, and must be the SAME OBJECT (mutable caches, locks and
    default payloads are shared by identity — a copy would split state in half);
  * the one place where a plain re-export was NOT enough
    (``_discover_provider_models``, which existing tests monkeypatch through) must
    keep honouring the patch;
  * the dead code deleted in ARCH-07 must stay deleted.
