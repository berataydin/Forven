# HARDEN-DATA-OPS (OPS-7): retention is resolved PER REASON, and pruning only
# ever considers snapshots of the SAME reason. Before this, one shared cap of 3
# spanned every reason, so a single operator/pre-migration snapshot could evict
# the entire scheduled-backup history — and 3 dailies is a 3-day recovery
# horizon, far too short to notice a slow corruption in the trade/position/
# verdict/equity record. Each reason now carries its own bounded window.
#
# Sized against DISK, not just comfort: the live DB is multi-GB and the online
# backup copies every page, so each snapshot costs roughly one DB. A week of
# dailies plus three migration generations is ~10 DB-sizes on disk — raise
# either of these only with the free space to back it, or set
# FORVEN_DB_BACKUP_RETENTION to override every reason at once.
#
# NOTE: per-reason windows bound each reason but say NOTHING about the sum, and
# every script that invents a new reason adds another window. The global
# ceiling below is what actually bounds the directory.

# pre-migration, assign-execution-profiles, recover-cross-asset-rehomed-
# strategies, reset-paper-trades — the per-reason windows alone permit ~19
# snapshots, and at the live DB's multi-GB size that is tens of gigabytes on a
# volume that also has to hold the live database itself. Filling that volume is
# strictly worse than losing a backup: SQLite writes start failing and the
# trade/position/equity record stops being written at all.
#
# So: total managed-snapshot bytes may not exceed a multiple of the live DB,
# whatever the per-reason windows say. Override with an absolute byte count in
